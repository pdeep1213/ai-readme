# ai-readme

Welcome to the `ai-readme` project! This project is designed to streamline the process of creating high-quality README files for your projects using AI capabilities. Although currently without a detailed description, this project leverages powerful tools and libraries to simplify README creation.

## Installation

To get started with `ai-readme`, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have those prerequisites, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pdeep1213/ai-readme.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ai-readme
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```

## Usage

`ai-readme` is equipped with several scripts to facilitate development and usage:

- **Start the Application**: Run the following command to execute the project.
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
  This script uses `ts-node` to run the TypeScript files directly.

- **Development Mode**: For active development, use the `dev` script. It also executes the main TypeScript file.
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Build the Project**: To compile the TypeScript files into JavaScript, use the `build` script.
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Command-line Interface**: If you want to interact with the project via the command line, use:
  ```bash
  npm run cli
  ```

## Dependencies

The `ai-readme` project relies on several dependencies and development dependencies to function effectively:

### Main Dependencies

- **chalk**: Used for styling and coloring terminal output.
- **commander**: A library for parsing command-line options.
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **inquirer**: Provides a collection of common interactive command-line user interfaces.
- **openai**: Integrates OpenAI services for AI operations.

### Development Dependencies

- **@types/node**: TypeScript definitions for Node.js.
- **ts-node**: Allows execution of TypeScript directly in Node.js.
- **typescript**: The TypeScript language which is used for development.

Ensure all dependencies are installed using `npm install` to avoid any issues during execution.

Happy documenting with `ai-readme`!
